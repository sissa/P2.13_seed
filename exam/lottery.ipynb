    "# The Lottery Ticket Hypothesis\n",
    "\n",
    "The aim of this exercise is to explore a somewhat misterious property of deep neural networks \n",
    "(DNN), i.e. the existence of very small subnetworks S of a given network N that are *trainable* \n",
    "and can reach the same performance of N (or even higher). \n",
    "\n",
    "This intriguing observation has been elevated to the rank of an **hypothesis** in the seminal work by Frankle & Carbin [3]\n",
    "\n",
    "https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.03635\n",
    "\n",
    "*Any large network that trains successfully contains a subnetwork that is initialized such that - when trained in isolation - it can match the accuracy of the original network in at most the same number of training iterations*\n",
    "\n",
    "The authors metaphorically called this subnetwork as a *winning ticket*.\n",
    "\n",
    "In some cases these subnetworks are really small. We can find subnetworks with the  $\\approx 1 \\%$ or less of the original connections.\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine the possible applications of such tiny DNNs. Being small means less memory and less computation required: this can be crucial in developing embedded systems that, given a target performance to be reached, can afford it with lower resources, including energy consumption.\n",
    "\n",
    "From a theoretical viewpoint there is also another interesting angle. If these subnetworks are so small then, shall we think differently about the problem of *overparametrization*?\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us state it more clearly. A very diffuse concern about DNNs is the fact that the number of parameters is often vastly larger then the number of data points. For example we will work in this notebook with a network with $\\approx 400,000$ *trainable* parameters on the MNIST dataset, that has 60,000 training samples. This means that on average we have 7 parameters for each data point.\n",
    "If we compare this situation with polynomial regression of a dataset of 10 points, for example, a polynomial of degree 10 (that has 11 parameters) overfits the data perfectly. But in DNNs overfitting - while still there - is not as severe as we could expect.\n",
    "\n",
    "But now, if we can reduce by two orders of magnitude the number of parameters in DNNs, does this concern still hold?\n",
    "We don't know the answer, and that's *one* of the reasons why we are here.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are PyTorch beginners, but what we saw in the course is enough to approach this *research* problem in DNNs, from an empirical viewpoint. Hopefully, this will give you stimuli to explore more in depth these problems, adding your perspective to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another point of this exercise is to make experience of *new strategies in research and knowledge dissemination*. \n",
    "Short communications - going straight to the point - are very effective indeed as a *first* exposition to a new subject. "

    "- retrain the network from this starting configuration but with the zero weights frozen (not trained)\n",
